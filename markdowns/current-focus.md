# On Using LLM With Digital marketing and Website Management Tasks

## Introduction

Ever since OpenAI released ChatGPT last year, I've been captivated by its potential to redefine productivity and creativity, not just for me but also for small businesses, nonprofits, creators, and entrepreneurs. So, in the coming months, I will keep on experimenting and exploring how to push forward this new paradigm in digital marketing and website management.

## About my 9 to 5 

Currently, I work full-time for a medical device company, handling a variety of tasks from website management to web analytics. I have been doing this for the past 4 years and love it there. However, I'm expanding my scope to include freelance projects that can benefit from my skill set, especially those that can leverage machine learning.

## The LLM Boost

ChatGPT has been a game-changer for me. For example, I used to maintain this website as a static files on GitHub, a task that required a lot of manual content updating, since when I build it in 2017, I wanted to do it without using any tool, so I could get a good handle on HTML, CSS and JS. However, as the amount of pages grew and as well as getting busy with work, it's have been hard to keep it updated as well as starting a blog, until, I had access to GPT4. I was able to build my own static website generator from scratch in just one weekend. The tools? Python, YAML for configuration files, and some Markdown for the blogs posts. 

## Human in the Loop

It did not happen in one go but with a couple of prompts. It was a lot of refiniment and learning. I prompts for the requirement, the code writing as well as the debugging. I think working with LLM tools and API is great since you can always run the code in your machine to test the output. I am glad this project was a success and will be brainstorming on more things to builds. That's the beauty of technologies like ChatGPT is not just their standalone capabilities but how they empower humans to be more productive and creative. It's what I call the "Human in the Loop" paradigm, where we are not replacing humans; we're augmenting them and so far I love the productivity boosts. s

## Moving Forward

So, where do we go from here? I will keep blogging and create a couple of small tools to learn more about this new phase of Human-Computer interaction and field I am getting more and more passionate about. So stay tuned for more updates, and feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating to push this exciting new paradigm forward.
