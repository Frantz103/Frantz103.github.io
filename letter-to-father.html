      <h1 class="blog-h1">Why I am starting a social business </h1>
      <h2>(An open letter to my father )</h2>
      <p>Father, since I was a little boy you have always wanted 3 things from me.</p>

      <p>To love God.</br>
      To do well in school.</br>
      To succeed you in the family business.</p>

      <p>I did ok with school.</br>
      I am a Christian.</p>

      <p>But, about the family business.</br>
      It's a bit complicated.</p>

      <p>First, things have been difficult with the business. We lost our financial partner in 2013 while you have to pay college tuitions for 2 children in the US. The local economy crashed...</p>

      <p>This situation had pushed me to stay and work in the US a bit longer so I can save money and come back.</p>

      <p>How am in doing so far?</br>
       Not very well.</br>
       I had a couple of underpaid part-time contracts job in the US. Plus last year, I got my first full-time job to be fired 5 months later.</p>

       <p>So far, we can agree that most of my work life in the US, I spent it being either unemployed or underemployed.</p>

       <p>I am still amazed by the fact that you and mom continue to believe in me.</br>
       Thanks, dad. </p>

       <p>However, all these bad experiences were not that bad at all. I have learned a great deal from them. I have also met a lot of good people in the process, too.</p>

       <p>In college, I had my American family who helps me with grocery shopping every to week. They also invited me to all kind of social events so I could feel included, care for. They even pay for a full semester in college for me. Got me an airplane ticket to visit you in Haiti that time where you could not afford it. 2013 was very hard for the business.</p>

       <p>I met 3 friends from a student organization who became my roommate for a year. They would support me every time my rent was late. We share foods, well they share food with me. They also gave me a lot of rides. To go church, Walmart…</p>

       <p>I met others friends who I borrow money from whenever I was broke. I did a couple of time in Boston from him and another roommate. You know losing my job did not help things in Boston.</p>

       <p>I also meet my marketing professor who did so much for me. She organized a graduation party for me because no one in my family could afford to come.  She helps me with finding internships and work contracts. She wrote me the best reference letter I could have. She also helps you out without me asking during hurricane Matthew.</p>

       <p>She is proud of me too. When I told her I was fired, she told me it was ok. “This stuff happens…The company didn't deserve you”.</p>

       <p>There is also my uncle and his girlfriend. I have been living in Boston for two years. It’s been hard but they don’t let me pay for rent and help me with foods. </p>

       <p>Which explains how I got to work so cheap in Boston or Cambridge and be able to afford a long commute and search a bit longer for jobs. Sometimes to go to work, I  'll spend 4 hours every day in the public transit or the train station.  It helps me read a lot but it explains why I am always tired.</p>

       <p>Dad, I have met countless friends who have helped me. They have different religions, different culture, and point of view. It has helped me become a global citizen. This meant a lot to me and If you did not support me in to come to study in the US I would not have been able to have this experience in the US.</p>

       <p>Thank you, Dad.</p>

       <p>I hope I did not lose you. It's a long letter. But, you can see a pattern here.A lot of people have helped me when I was away from your home and a lot continue to do so.</p>

       <p>I want to help people too. I want to pay it back. </p>

       <p>This is not a shock. You have been pruning me for this life since I was little. You taught me the Christian value. You send me to a Catholic school where they teach me to care for the less fortunate. Your big dream for me is too come back in Haiti and give back to the community.</p>

       <p>You, too, are tired of the country situation. You would love to change the narrative. You always tell us stories that make us proud of being Haitian.</p>

       <p>There is this  Kennedy Quotes that is always on your tongue. 
         "
       ... ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." yeah this one.</p>

       <p>t was the main reason you send us to study in the US so we can come back with the best education and help the country.</p>

       <p>Here is the thing dad. Something has changed. I don't want the giving back philosophy to be an after taught in running or creating new business. I want a business that solves social issues. I want the whole business with purpose thing.</p>

       <p>It started since I was in high school.  The idea was half to bake but it was there. Remember, when I was 17, I was skipping dinner to spend time in the library. I was reading “ le pays en dehors, Deschooling society. Turn out I am a big fan of Ivan Illich.</p>

       <p>I also started to watch Ted talk in 2009. Then there was the Election of Obama with a yes we can campaign. The 2010 earthquake in the country was a big factor. It imprints the narrative of life is too short. College helped me see clearly: I join the green group organization on campus, service in the city, Chi Alpha. All these things push me to look in another direction where I have to reach a point of no return.</p>

       <p>I can’t do business as usual, dad. I am no longer attracted to it. I am only interested in social entrepreneurship.</p>

       <p>A type of business that is beneficial for the community. A type of business that work to help solved a development goal. Things like human rights, woman equality, poverty, the environment...</p>

       <p>You remember that crazy business idea I kept on telling you in the last four years.  A type of online marketplace for arts and crafts. As simple as it sounds, I care deeply about it and I am committed to making it work. 

      <p>It's was actually my first social business idea to help fight poverty amount artisans. This idea was the reason I learn to program a computer and learned photography</p>

      <p>I have learned so much in the past four years about launching a social business that it might feel for many that I have been wasting my time. I wasn’t. </p>

      <p>Yes, I have my setbacks. I have applied with 6 starts up incubator so I could get training and founding. They all turn me down. I had one that said maybe but a maybe is just a polite no.</p>

      <p>But I am doing it anyway. I have been working on it on the side for the last 4 years. </p>

      <p>I know I don't have money and you can't help me this time as much as you would. But don't worry. I'll start with what I have. Funny, you taught me that.</p>

      <p>So what is going to happen with the family business?</p>

      <p>Of course, I want to come back and work with you. This business means so much to me. I owe so much to this place and to you. </p>

      <p>But there is a catch dad.  I'll work with you with one condition. Your business will have to be business with a social mission.</p>

      <p>More on how later.</p>

      <p>
      Sincerely,</br>
      Your son who loves you so much.</p>
