      <h1 class="blog-h1">Why I am starting a social business </h1>
      <h2>(An open letter to my father )</h2>
      <p>Father, since I was a little boy you have always wanted 3 things from me.</p>

      <p>To love God.</br>
      To do well in school</br>
      To succeed you in the family business.</p>

      <p>I did ok with school.</br>
      I am a Christian.</p>

      <p>About the family business.</br>
      It's a bit complicated.</p>

      <p>First, things have been difficult with the business. We lost our financial partner in 2013 while you have to pay college tuitions for 2 children in the US. The local economy is very weak.</p>

      <p>This situation had pushed me to stay and work in the US a bit longer so I can save and come back.</p>

      <p>How am in doing so far?</br>
       Not very well.</br>
       I had a couple of underpaid part-time contracts job in the US. Plus last year, I got my first full-time job to be fired 5 months later.</p>

       <p>So far, we can agree that most of my work life in the US, I spent it being either unemployed or underemployed.</p>

       <p>I am still amazed by the fact that you and mom continue to believe in me.</br>
       Thanks, dad. </p>

       <p>However, all these bad experiences were not that bad at all. I have learned a great deal from them. I have also met a lot of good people in the process, too.</p>

       <p>In college, I had my American family who helps me with grocery shopping every to week. They also invited me to all kind of social events so I could feel included, care for. They even pay for a full semester in college for me. Got me an airplane ticket to visit you in Haiti that time where you could not afford it. 2013 was very hard for the business.</p>

       <p>I met 3 friends from a student organization who became my roommate for a year. They would support me every time my rent was late. We share foods, well they share food with me. They also gave me a lot of rides. To go church, Walmart…</p>

       <p>I met others friends who I borrow money from whenever I was broke. I did a couple of time in Boston from him and another roommate. You know losing my job did not help things in Boston.</p>

       <p>I also meet my marketing professor who did so much for me. She organized a graduation party for me because no one in my family could afford to come.  She helps me with finding internships and work contracts. She wrote me the best reference letter I could have. She also helps you out without me asking during hurricane Matthew.</p>

       <p>She is proud of me too. When I told her I was fired, she told me it was ok. “This stuff happens…The company didn't deserve you”.</p>

       <p>There is also my uncle and his girlfriend. I have been living in Boston for two years. It’s been hard but they don’t let me pay for rent and help me with foods. </p>

       <p>Which explains how I got to work so cheap in Boston or Cambridge and be able to afford a long commute and search a bit longer for jobs. Sometimes to go to work, I  'll spend 4 hours every day in the public transit or the train station.  It helps me read a lot but it explains why I am always tired.</p>

       <p>Dad, I have met countless friends who have helped me. They have different religions, different culture, and point of view. It has helped me become a global citizen. This meant a lot to me and If you did not support me in to come to study in the US I would not have been able to have this experience in the US.</p>

       <p>Thank you, Dad.</p>

       <p>I hope I did not lose you. It's a long letter. But, you can see a pattern here.A lot of people have helped me when I was away from your home and a lot continue to do so.</p>

       <p>I want to help people too. I want to pay it back. </p>

       <p>This is not a shock. You have been pruning me for this life since I was little. You taught me the Christian value. You send me to a Catholic school where they teach me to care for the less fortunate. Your big dream for me is too come back in Haiti and give back to the community.</p>

       <p>You, too, are tired of the country situation. You would love to change the narrative. You always tell us stories that make us proud of being Haitian.</p>
