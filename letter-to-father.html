      <h1 class="blog-h1">Why I am starting a social business </h1>
      <h2>(An open letter to my father )</h2>
      <p>Father, since I was a little boy you have always wanted 3 things from me.</p>

      <p>To love God.</br>
      To do well in school.</br>
      To succeed you in the family business.</p>

      <p>I did ok with school.</br>
      I am a Christian.</p>

      <p>But, about the family business.</br>
      It's a bit complicated.</p>

      <p>First, things have been difficult with the business. We lost our financial partner in 2013 while you have to pay tuition for 2 children in the US.</p>

      <p>This situation pushed me to stay and work in the US a bit longer so I can save money and come back.</p>

      <p>How am I doing?</br>
       Not very well.</p>

       <p>I had a couple of part-time contract jobs in the US. Then, I had my first full-time job only to be fired 5 months later.</p>

       <p>So far, we can agree that most of my work life in the US, I spent it being either unemployed or underemployed.</p>

       <p>I am still amazed by the fact that you and mom continue to believe in me.</p>

       <p>Thanks, dad. </p>

       <p>However, all these bad experiences were not that bad. I have learned a great deal from them. I have also met a lot of good people, too.</p>

       <p>In college, I had my American family who helped me with grocery shopping every two weeks. They also invited me to all kind of social events so I could feel included, cared for, welcomed. They even paid for a full semester in college for me. Plus, they got me an airplane ticket to visit you in Haiti during the time you could not afford it. 2013 was very hard for the business.</p>

       <p>I met three friends from a student organization who became my roommates for a year. They support me every time my rent was late. We share food, well they share food with me. They also gave me a lot of rides to the airport, Walmart, the church</p>

       <p>I met other friends from whom I borrowed money from whenever I was broke. I even borrowed a couple of time in Boston from them. You know losing my job did not help things. One of these friends was my roommate in college and another was an aerospace engineer. They were both from India. You see it's been 3 years since I graduated and they are still my friend from afar. </p>

       <p>I also meet my marketing professor who did so much for me. Remember when she organized a graduation party for me because no one in my family could afford to come.  She also helped me with finding work contracts, and internships. She wrote me the best reference letter I could have. She also helped you out without me asking during hurricane Matthew.</p>

       <p>She is proud of me too. When I told her I was fired, she told me it was ok. “This stuff happens…The company didn't deserve you”.</p>

       <p>There is also my uncle and his girlfriend. I have been living in Boston for two years. It’s been hard here and lonely but they don’t let me pay rent and helped with foods. </p>

       <p>This explains how I was able to work cheaply in Boston able to afford a long commute, and search a bit longer for jobs. For a year, I spent 4 hours every day commuting to work. This allowed me to read a lot but also explains why I was always tired.</p>

       <p>Dad, I have met countless friends who have helped me. They have different religions,  different cultures, and  different points of view. Meeting them helped me become a global citizen. This meant a lot to me. If you did not support me to come to study in the US, I would not have been able to experience this.</p>

       <p>Thank you, Dad.</p>

       <p>I hope I did not lose you. It's a long letter. But, you can see a pattern here. A lot of people have helped me when I was away from your home and a lot continue to do so.</p>

       <p>I want to help people too. I want to pay it forward. </p>

       <p>This is not a surprise. You have been pruning me for this life since I was little. You taught me the Christian values. You sent me to Catholic school where they taught me to care for the less fortunate. Your big dream for me was to come back to Haiti and give back to the community after my studies.</p>

       <p>Plus, you, too, are tired of the country's situation. You don't like things as they are and would love to change the country's narrative. You always tell us stories that make us proud of being Haitian.</p>

       <p>There is this Kennedy Quote that is always on your tongue. 
      " ... ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." yeah this one.</p>

       <p>This was the main reason you sent us to study in the US so we can come back with the best education and help the country.</p>

       <p>Here is the thing dad. Something has changed. I don't want to run a business and give back later when the business can afford it. I don't want this philosophy. I don't want "giving back" to be an afterthought in running or creating new business. I love business that solves social issues. I want the whole business with purpose thing.</p>

       <p> I started to see things like that since I was in high school.  The idea was half bake but it was there. Remember I was skipping dinner to spend time in the library. I was reading books on social issues. Books like “le pays en dehors, Deschooling society. Turns out I am a big fan of Ivan Illich.</p>

       <p>I also started to watch Ted talk in 2009. Then there was the Election of Obama with a yes we can campaign. The 2010 earthquake in the country was also a big factor. It imprints the narrative of life is too short to not do anything.</p>
       
       <p>I can’t do business as usual, dad. I am no longer attracted to it. I am only interested in social entrepreneurship.</p>

       <p>The type of business that is beneficial for the community. A type of business that works to help solve a development goal. Things like human rights, woman equality, poverty, the environment...</p>

       <p>You remember that crazy business idea I kept on telling you in the past four years.  A type of online marketplace for arts and crafts. As simple as it sounds, I care deeply about it and I am committed to making it work. 

      <p>It's was actually my first social business idea to help fight poverty amongst artisans. This idea was the reason I learn to program a computer, do basic graphic designs and learned photography.</p>

      <p>I have learned so much in the past four years about launching a business that it might feel for many that I have been wasting my time. I wasn’t. </p>

      <p>Yes, I have some setbacks. I have applied with 6 starts up incubators so I could get training and funding. They all turn me down. I had one that said maybe but a maybe is just a polite no.</p>

      <p>But I am doing it anyway. I have been working on it on the side for the last 4 years and I am committed to launch it in the coming weeks </p>

      <p>I know I don't have money and you can't help me as much as you would, but don't worry. I'll start with what I have. Funny, you taught me that.</p>

      <p>So what is going to happen with the family business?</p>

      <p>I will come back and work with you. This business means so much to me. I owe so much to this place and to you. </p>

      <p>But there is a catch dad.  I'll work with you on one condition. Your business will have to be business with a social mission. More on how later.</p>


      <p>But, for all the reasons I advance for joining the social entrepreneurship movement are good but they should not be the reason one becomes a discover social entrepreneur.</p>

      <p>The truth is all of us have a duty to help</p>

      <p>I discovered this concept while reading “Give Work” a book by Leila Janah, my social entrepreneur role model. The concept is simple. We should help the poor because we participated in making them poor.</p>

      <p>You see money and goods flow freely around the world while people can’t. This has created lack of opportunities and resources for a good part of the world population. Yes, some countries have good governance but it’s only for their local citizens.</p>

      <p>So when you buy a t-shirt made by let say a citizen form my country, Haiti.  You participate in that.The retailer of the t-shirt ripe most of the profit because of globalization while the factory worker could not get a good wage.  Working for the factory is the only job he could find and moving to a better location to find a better job is close to impossible.</p>

      <p>Also, let’s not forget that it is not an easy thing to make a t-shirt in a sweetshop. It ’s very hard. The work is so repetitive and the working conditions are tough and sometimes, dangerous.</p>

      <p>But the market does not reward them for that.

      <p>So I urged all of you who can do something to do something. 
       For example, buy products who are more fair to marginalized people. Donate to good causes. Votes with your money. </p>

      <p>If you are a business owners, buy from vendors who are also making an impact. Add a social mission to your business model. Hired marginalized people. </p>

      <p>You could also become a social entrepreneur, social services providers, a social activist or all three or an hybrid of them if you can.</p>

      <p>Do something. It’s our duty to do so.</p>

      <p>
      Sincerely,</br>
      Frantz</br>
      Your son who loves you so much.</p>
