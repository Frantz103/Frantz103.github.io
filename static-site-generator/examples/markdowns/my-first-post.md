# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post using the **Simple Static Site Generator**.

## What is this?

This static site generator converts Markdown files into beautiful HTML pages. It supports:

- YAML front matter for metadata
- Markdown formatting
- Code syntax highlighting
- Custom templates

## How it works

1. Write your content in Markdown
2. Add YAML front matter with metadata
3. Run the build script
4. Your HTML is generated automatically

### Example Code

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

That's it! Simple and effective.
